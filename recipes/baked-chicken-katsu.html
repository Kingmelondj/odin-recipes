   <h2>Just in case you haven't heard of this dish before, Chicken Katsu is a Japanese version of chicken cutlets. 
         Here are some of the characteristics. 
   </h2>

   <div>
      <p class="p1">Chicken breasts are not pounded as thin as western-style chicken cutlets.</p>
   </div>

   <div>
      <p class="p2">Chicken katsu is coated with <strong><em>panko (パン粉)</em></strong>, or <em>Japanese breadcrumbs</em>. 
          They are white crumbs from Japanese milk bread (Shokupan) and they are lighter and airy.
      </p>
   </div>

   <div>
      <p class="p3">It is typically <strong>deep-fried</strong>, not shallow pan-fried (except for the home cook version).</p>
      <p class="p3">Served with a sweet and savory <em>tonkatsu sauce</em>, a thicker version of Worcestershire sauce.</p>
   </div>

   <h3>5 Tips for making Baked Chicken Katsu</h3>
      
   <p class="p1"><strong>Toast the Panko</strong></p>
   
   <div>
      <p>The most important tip to make the perfect 
         baked chicken katsu is to toast the panko 
         first and then coat the chicken with the toasted panko. Why?
      </p>
   </div>
   <div id="box1">
      <!--l1 = l1~ "list 1 etc."-->
      <ul class="ul1">
         <li class="l1">The toasted panko gives the chicken katsu an even golden colored crust. 
            If you bake the chicken coated with uncooked panko breading, it is difficult
            to achieve a beautiful uniform color because the oven has hot spots. 
            With the toasted panko, your baked chicken katsu will always look like the deep-fried ones.
         </li>
         <li class="l2">Toasting makes the panko extra crispy and crunchy. 
            Toasting helps to remove any moisture in the panko and makes it extra crisp
            and crunchy.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </div>
      
   <p class="p1"><strong>Butterfly the chicken</strong></p>

   <div>
      <p>Cooking juicy and moist chicken breasts can be challenging. 
         Besides using organic chicken, I always make sure that the 
         chicken pieces have even thickness. We'll discuss more later.
      </p>
   </div>

      <p class="p1"><strong>Add oil to the beaten egg</strong></p>
   <div>
      <p>Eggs and meat are like water and oil, so the batter and meat 
         can potentially come off during or after deep frying. 
         By mixing the beaten egg with oil in advance, the breading adheres to the meat,
         making it difficult to come off.
      </p>
   </div>

      <p class="p1"><strong>Use a wire rack</strong></p>
   <div>
      <p>When baking the chicken, it's important to use a wire rack so that
         the air circulates underneath the chicken. If you don't have a wire rack,
         you may want to flip the chicken halfway to make sure the bottom side is also
         cooked through.
      </p>
   </div>

     <p class="p1"><strong>Don't overcook the chicken</strong></p>
   <div>
      <p>
         Chicken breasts can get dry easily when you over bake them as
         it has less fat (than chicken thighs). Measuring the internal 
         temperature of the chicken is the best way to prevent this issue.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>Once the temperature reaches 160ºF (71ºC) for 15 seconds or 165ºF (74ºC) 
         instantly, you must immediately take out the chicken from the oven.
      </p>
   </div>

<h6>How to Butterfly the Chicken Breast (Kannon Biraki)</h6>
<div>
   <p>Chicken breasts are uneven and when you wait until the thick part of the
      chicken is cooked through, the thinner parts of the chicken are already overcooked,
      resulting in dry meat.
   </p>
</div>

   <p>To prevent this from happening, it's important to make sure the chicken breasts 
      are even thickness. You can pound the meat with a mallet or you can butterfly 
      (and pound) the chicken.
   </p>
</div>
   <p>Typically, to butterfly the chicken breast, you would slice it in half horizontally.
      In Japan, we have a different way to butterfly the chicken, and this special cutting 
      technique is called <strong><em>Kannon Biraki (観音開き).</em></strong>
   </p>
</div>

<div class="h7">Kannon Biraki - Japanese Cutting Technique</div>

<div>
   <p>With a sharp knife, score the chicken breast lengthwise along 
      the top center line, cutting about halfway through the thickness 
      of the breast; do not cut completely through. Then, turn the knife 
      parallel to the cutting board and slice the chicken breast from the 
      center toward the left side (or the right side, if you're left-handed) 
      to make it evenly thin.
   </p>
</div>
<div>
   <p>Stop before you cut all the way through the edge; then, open it like a book.
      Imagine we're creating a French door here. Rotate the breast 180 degrees and 
      butterfly the second side in the same manner from the center toward the left 
      (if you hold the knife in your right hand), creating another “door.
