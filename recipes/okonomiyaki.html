  <h2>Okonomiyaki is a savory Japanese pancake that originated in Osaka. The batter is made from flour, 
      eggs, dashi (bonito stock), and shredded cabbage. 
  </h2>

    <p>Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) is sometimes called “Japanese savory pancake” or “Japanese pizza”, but personally,
       I think it’s more like a dish between savory pancake and frittata.
    </p>

    <p>It’s made with flour, eggs, tempura scraps (tenkasu), cabbage, and pork belly slices and topped with a 
       variety of condiments like okonomiyaki sauce, Japanese mayonnaise, dried seaweed, and dried bonito flakes.
    </p>

    <p>If you don’t eat pork or prefer another protein choice, this dish is very adaptable. The possibility for 
       the filling and topping choices are endless, which is why this dish in Japanese translates to “grilled as
       you like it” – Okonomi (as you like it) Yaki (grill).
