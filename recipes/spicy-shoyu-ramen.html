      <h2>I hope you are hungry because we're going to make some hot bowls of <em>Spicy 
          Shoyu Ramen (ピリ辛醤油ラーメン)</em> together. If noodle soup is your comfort food, you are going to enjoy this one.
      </h2>

    <div>
        <p>Shoyu <strong>(醤油)</strong> means soy sauce in Japanese. 
          Shoyu ramen simply refers to ramen served with a soy 
          sauce-based broth that is usually in clear, brown color. 
          It is one of the three main types of ramen categorized by broth flavors. 
          If you're in Tokyo, shoyu ramen is the most familiar form of ramen you'll find.

            <li>Chashu</li>
            <li>Ramen Egg (ajitsuke tamago or ajitama) or soft-boiled egg</li>
            <li>Menma (seasoned bamboo shoots)</li>
            <li>Narutomaki (fish cake)</li>

              <p>It may read like a long list of toppings, but you can definitely decide what 
                you'd like to add to your ramen. Seasoned shiitake mushrooms or tofu are a 
                great stand-in for chashu if you're vegetarian. Feel free to keep it as simple
                or complex as you like!

     </div>

     <h4>Cooking Steps</h4>

    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the toppings <strong>AHEAD OF TIME</strong>. 
            Both Chashu and Ramen Egg should be made the previous day.
            This way, on the day of serving ramen, you just need half an
            hour to put it together.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the soup. Combine all the soup broth ingredients and let it simmer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook the ramen noodles and assemble the ramen. Make sure you cook the noodles
            just al dente because the hot broth will continue to cook the noodles. 
            Drain and divide into individual ramen bowls. 
            Pour the soup broth and add the toppings to the ramen.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and reserve 1 tsp ginger, 
            grated, with juice. Mince or press 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press). 
            Tip: If you're unsure how much ginger flavor you'd like, start with less and 
            add more later.
        </li>
        <br>

      <div>
       <p><strong>To Prepare the Soup Broth</strong></p>
      </div>
  
        <li>Set a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 1 Tbsp roasted sesame oil, 
            the garlic, and the grated ginger. Cook until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. 
            Tip: Make sure not to burn the aromatics.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Add 2 tsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean paste) and stir for 15 seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add 1½ cups chicken stock/broth, 1½ cups dashi (Japanese soup stock), 
            and 2½ Tbsp soy sauce and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the 
            heat and simmer for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Taste the soup now and adjust the seasoning with 1 tsp Diamond Crystal 
            kosher salt and ⅛ tsp white pepper powder. Don't be shy about adding salt 
            because the broth will taste less salty after you add the noodles. 
            Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low, and keep the soup barely 
            simmering while you quickly boil the noodles. You want the soup piping 
            hot and ready to pour as soon as the noodles are done cooking.
        </li>
        <br>

        <div>
          <p><strong>To Cook the Noodles</strong></p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <li>Before cooking, loosen up 2 servings fresh ramen noodles with your hands. 
            Once the big pot of water is boiling, add the noodles and cook according 
            to the package instructions. Here, I cook the noodles inside a big noodle 
            strainer (I got it in Japan) that I've set inside the pot.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>While cooking, stir and separate the noodles with chopsticks. 
            When the noodles are done cooking, drain them well in a strainer, 
            shaking it a few times to drain the water thoroughly (otherwise it will 
            dilute the soup broth).
        </li>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Divide the noodles into the individual ramen bowls. 
          Pour about 1½ cups (360 ml) of the hot soup broth into each bowl.
          </strong></p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <li>Now, arrange the noodles in the bowl for an attractive presentation. 
            First, lift the soup-soaked noodles high and straighten them. 
            When the noodles are neatly aligned, fold the noodles from the edge of the bowl
            and place them over the noodles in the soup. This is an optional step, but ramen
            shops typically do this so the ramen looks pretty.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Quickly and neatly arrange the prepared toppings on top of the noodles. 
            Serve immediately and season to taste with additional white pepper powder 
            and optional la-yu chili oil.
        </li>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p><strong>To Store</strong></p>
        </div>
        <li>You can keep the leftover soup and toppings separately 
            in airtight containers and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. 
            Cook the noodles right before serving.
        </li>
        <br>


      </ol>

      <h5>Dashi <em>(Japanese Soup Stock)</em> & Doubanjiang <em>(Spicy Chili Bean Paste)</em></h5>

      <div>
        <p>Besides the chicken stock, I also used dashi <em>(Japanese soup broth)</em>
          to give the soup broth extra depth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>For this recipe, I actually used my favorite Dashi Packet to make dashi.
          Since I wanted a strong dashi flavor, I used two packets instead of 
          recommended one packet for the measured water.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The second key ingredient is doubanjiang <strong>(豆板醤)</strong> or spicy chili bean paste.
          It's a combination of fermented broad beans as the main ingredient, soybeans,
          and often hot chilies. The salty, savory, umami-rich paste adds an incredible
          depth and character to the broth that you should not substitute.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          You can add more if you like your soup to be spicy, 
          but a small amount would be enough to give it a good kick.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-Spicy doubanjiang:</strong> You can find non-spicy versions made in Taiwan, 
          Hong Kong, and Guangdong. It has the same savory depth in the paste but without heat.
          To distinguish the two versions, the Sichuan doubanjiang is called la-doubanjiang 
          <strong>(辣豆瓣醬</strong>, “la” <strong>(辣)</strong> meaning 'hot' or 'spicy').
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Taiwanese brands like Kangshan <strong>(岡山)</strong> and Ming Teh <strong>(明德)</strong>
          offer the doubanjiang made from fermented broad beans and soybeans, 
          and they usually have both spicy and non-spicy versions. I get Kangshan 
          <strong>(岡山)</strong> brand at my local Chinese market. 
          Amazon does not sell the non-spicy doubanjiang at this time.
        </p>
      </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Ming Teh Doubanjiang (non-spicy) - Yummy Bazaar</li>
          <li>Kangshan Doubanjiang (non-spicy) - Walmart</li>
          <li>Kangshan Doubanjiang (non-spicy) - Weee!</li>
        </ul>
      <div></div>
        <p>
          <strong>Doubanjiang substitute:</strong> If you really can't find doubanjiang,
          you can use gochujang <em>(Korean chili paste; spicy)</em> or <em>doenjang
          (Korean soybean paste; non-spicy).</em> However, the ingredients are
          slightly different and have different flavor profiles.

        <p><strong>Where to find fresh ramen noodles.</strong></p>
      </div> 
      <div>
        <p>
          Fresh ramen noodles are made from <strong>four ingredients</strong>: wheat flour,
          water, salt, and kansui. <em>Despite the yellowish color, the noodles
          do not contain eggs.</em> Kansui, an alkaline solution, is what gives 
          ramen its yellow tint and springy texture.
        </p>
      </div> 
        <ul>
          <li>Ramen noodles are either <strong>straight <em>(ストレート麺)</em> or wavy <em>(ちぢれ麺)</em></strong>.
              Generally, straight noodles are used for tonkotsu ramen while wavy
              noodles are used for soy sauce ramen, salt ramen, and miso ramen, 
              but of course, there are exceptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ramen noodles have <strong>6 different thicknesses:</strong> ultra-thin (極細麺), thin (細麺),
            medium-thin (中細麺), medium-thick (中太麺), thick (太麺), and extra thick (極太麺).
          </li>
        </ul>
      <div>
        <p><em>The ramen noodles used in shoyu ramen are usually the springy, wavy type.</em></p>
      </div> 
      <div>
        <p>Big Japanese grocery stores like Mitsuwa, Nijiya, and Marukai (Tokyo Central) sell 
          packages of fresh ramen noodles (with or without soup packages included). 
          Some large Korean and Chinese grocery stores also carry packages of fresh 
          ramen noodles from Myojo and Yamachan Ramen.
        </p>
      </div> 
      <div>
        <p><em>Sun Noodles make great noodles and they ship domestically!</em></p>
      </div> 
      <div>
        <p>If you don't have access to fresh ramen noodles, you can purchase dried 
          ramen noodles <strong><em></em>(what we call Chukamen, 中華麺)</em></strong> 
          by the <strong>HIME</strong> brand at 
          Japanese or Asian grocery stores or Amazon.

          check out my favorite vegan-friendly ramen noodles by 
          Gluten Free Meister (Kobayashi Seimen).
